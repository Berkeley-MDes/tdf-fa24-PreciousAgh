# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week I learnt how to laser cut and Design on Adobe Illustrator

**Project Idea:** I initially designed a wooden flower, which I later decided to convert into a coaster decor by adding squares to the design.

**Key Learnings:**
1. Adobe Illustrator Skills:
   I learned how to design intricate patterns and adjust shapes to fit the laser cutter's capabilities.
2. Laser Cutting Process:
   - Gained experience with using the laser cutter, especially understanding how different line thicknesses affect cutting time.
   - The original design had thick lines, causing the cutting process to take up to 2 hours.
   - By adjusting to thinner lines, I reduced the cutting time significantly to just 12 minutes.

**Challenges:**
    The initial coaster was too large, and I had to make design adjustments for efficiency.
    
**Next Steps:**
Plan to reuse the leftover wood from the coaster project to create a wooden keychain.

**Next week plans**
- Continue learning tutorials on Rhino

# Week 2 # 

This week, I focused on experimenting with the existing cellphone stand file in Grasshopper, created my own rhino file and created a shape on grasshopper. Here‚Äôs a summary of my progress and observations:

---

# Experimenting with the Existing Cellphone Stand Design # 

**Baking the Existing 3D Model:**
I began by baking the current cellphone stand design to visualize the 3D image.‚Ä®

**Sphere Radius Adjustments:**
I then experimented with the sphere radius, initially set between 40 to 50 units. I extended the radius to 61 units to observe how this affected the overall design.

**Fit Issues with Increased Sphere Size**
When the sphere radius reached 61 units, I noticed that it was too large for the phone fitting, leading to a red warning indicating that the design would not fit the phone properly.‚Ä®(Insert an image showing the warning or red indicator in Grasshopper here to emphasize the fit issue.)‚Ä®This observation suggests that there is a set limit for the design to ensure the proper fitting of the phone. I am currently looking for the specific parameter that controls this limit.

**Exploring the Cellphone Stand Cluster**
To find the fitting limit, I navigated to the cellphone stand cluster, which manages key design parameters like the phone width in millimeters. This setting ensures the phone fits correctly in the stand.

By double-clicking on the cluster, I accessed its internal components, where I found detailed controls for adjusting dimensions like the phone width. This allowed me to experiment with different values to achieve a better fit for the phone.‚Ä®

**Experimenting with Shape Changes**
I also experimented with altering the shape of the cellphone stand, attempting to change the design from two spheres to one box. However, I decided to move on from this experiment as the design wasn‚Äôt progressing as expected.
