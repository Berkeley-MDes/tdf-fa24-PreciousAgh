# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week I learnt how to laser cut and Design on Adobe Illustrator

**Project Idea:** I initially designed a wooden flower, which I later decided to convert into a coaster decor by adding squares to the design.

**Key Learnings:**
1. Adobe Illustrator Skills:
   I learned how to design intricate patterns and adjust shapes to fit the laser cutter's capabilities.
2. Laser Cutting Process:
   - Gained experience with using the laser cutter, especially understanding how different line thicknesses affect cutting time.
   - The original design had thick lines, causing the cutting process to take up to 2 hours.
   - By adjusting to thinner lines, I reduced the cutting time significantly to just 12 minutes.

**Challenges:**
    The initial coaster was too large, and I had to make design adjustments for efficiency.
    
**Next Steps:**
Plan to reuse the leftover wood from the coaster project to create a wooden keychain.

**Next week plans**
- Continue learning tutorials on Rhino
