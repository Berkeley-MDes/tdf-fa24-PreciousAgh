This week I learnt how to laser cut and Design on Adobe Illustrator

**Project Idea:** I initially designed a wooden flower, which I later decided to convert into a coaster decor by adding squares to the design.

**Key Learnings:**
1. Adobe Illustrator Skills:
   I learned how to design intricate patterns and adjust shapes to fit the laser cutter's capabilities.
2. Laser Cutting Process:
   - Gained experience with using the laser cutter, especially understanding how different line thicknesses affect cutting time.
   - The original design had thick lines, causing the cutting process to take up to 2 hours.
   - By adjusting to thinner lines, I reduced the cutting time significantly to just 12 minutes.

**Challenges:**
    The initial coaster was too large, and I had to make design adjustments for efficiency.
    
**Next Steps:**
Plan to reuse the leftover wood from the coaster project to create a wooden keychain.
